# caption-generator
The Gemini CLI helped me create this tool to generate burned-in captions for short videos, saving me the cost of paying for other editing platforms.

Don't forget to use this to activate a Python virtual environment on macOS or Linux.
```
source .venv/bin/activate
```
I mainly use the .srt file to import the captions into CapCut, where I then do the final editing.

The code is not perfect and may have some errors in the captions, but it's easily editable, so that is fine.
